## 💾 KvXbyte's Reflection:
The command line isn't just a tool—it's a translator between the system and the analyst. These labs made that crystal clear. Whether I’m responding to alerts or parsing logs, I’m building the reflexes that every SOC analyst needs to move fast, dig deep, and think critically.
